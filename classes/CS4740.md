## General Information

An introduction to natural language processing, i.e. parsing, understanding, and generating human language. Covers a broad range of topics.

## Prerequisites

[[ CS 2110 ]]

## Topics Covered

- Language models (e.g. Markov chains)
- Word sense disambiguation
- Part-of-speech tagging
- Information extraction
- Grammars
- Parsing

## Workload

Spring 2015: a few projects, a couple homeworks, an in-class prelim and a final. Overall not too much work, but it was interesting, and projects gave you leeway to implement them however you wanted. We often competed to get the best accuracy, e.g. in classifying spam or in answering natural language questions.

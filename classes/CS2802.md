## General Information

An honors introduction to discrete math.

## Prerequisites

From Spring 2020 course page: The official prerequisite for course is a programming course, but it's not critical. If you are taking CS 1110 or CS 2110 concurrently, that's fine. If not, and you haven't taken any programming courses, speak to Prof. Halpern.

## Topics Covered

- Proving things, a little logic, and induction: Chapters 1, 3, 5, 8
- Number Theory: Chapter 9
- Combinatorics: Chapter 15
- Probability: Chapters 17 - 20
- Graph Theory: Chapters 10, 12, 13

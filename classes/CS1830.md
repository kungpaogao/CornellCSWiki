## General Information

Meets for 2 hours a week at night with a coffee break halfway through. Reasonably small class. Not really a CS course, cross listed as INFO 1810. As far as I know it only fills major/advisor approved electives.

## Prerequisites

## Topics Covered

Whatever the professor feels like teaching at the time; that's why he made the course title deliberately vague.

## Workload

Approximately none. The goal of the course is to teach you things and get you thinking not stress you out.
